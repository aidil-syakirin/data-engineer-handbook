# Week 5 Data Pipeline Maintenance

### Homework

Imagine you're in a group of 4 data engineers, you will be in charge of creating the following things:

You are in charge of managing these 5 pipelines that cover the following business areas:
 
 - Unit-level profit needed for experiments
 - Aggregate profit reported to investors
 - Aggregate growth reported to investors
 - Daily growth needed for experiments
 - Aggregate engagement reported to investors

You are in charge of figuring out the following things:

- Who is the primary and secondary owners of these pipelines?
- What is an on-call schedule that is fair
  - Think about holidays too!
- Creating run books for all pipelines that report metrics to investors
  - What could potentially go wrong in these pipelines?
  - (you don't have to recommend a course of action though since this is an imagination exercise)
  
Create a markdown file submit it!
